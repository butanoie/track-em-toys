## Slug Rules

All slugs MUST match: `/^[a-z0-9]+(?:-[a-z0-9]+)*$/`

- Lowercase kebab-case only
- Strip apostrophes, periods, parentheses, special characters
- **Characters**: always start with the base name (e.g., `optimus-prime`). Only append a
  continuity suffix if the base slug **already exists** in `existingCharacterSlugs`
  (e.g., `megatron-bw` because `megatron` is already taken by G1 Megatron)
- **Items**: `{product-code-lower}-{character-name}` (e.g., `ft-03-quake-wave`, `05701-bumblebee`)
- **Appearances**: `{character-slug}-{source-descriptor}` (e.g., `optimus-prime-g1-cartoon`)
- **Reference tables**: descriptive name (e.g., `dinobots`, `beast-era`, `fanstoys-mainline`).
  Same collision-first rule applies: only disambiguate on actual collision **within the same
  slug set**. Each table has its own slug set — a sub-group slug `predacons` does NOT collide
  with a faction slug `predacon` because they're different tables. Check `existingFactionSlugs`
  for factions, `existingSubGroupSlugs` for sub-groups, etc.

### Slug scoping

| Entity                | Scope         | Unique constraint                |
| --------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Franchises            | Global        | `(slug)`                         |
| Manufacturers         | Global        | `(slug)`                         |
| Factions              | Per-franchise | `(slug, franchise_id)`           |
| Sub-groups            | Per-franchise | `(slug, franchise_id)`           |
| Continuity families   | Per-franchise | `(slug, franchise_id)`           |
| Toy lines             | Per-franchise | `(slug, franchise_id)`           |
| Characters            | Per-franchise | `(slug, franchise_id)`           |
| Character appearances | Per-character | `(slug, character_id)`           |
| Items                 | Per-franchise | `(slug, franchise_id)`           |

### Cross-continuity disambiguation

**Only disambiguate when there is an actual slug collision in the SAME slug set.** Do NOT
preemptively append continuity suffixes — check the relevant `existing*Slugs` set first.

**Collision checks are per-table.** A sub-group slug `predacons` does NOT collide with a
faction slug `predacon` — they live in different tables with separate uniqueness constraints.
Similarly, a character slug `inferno` does not collide with a faction or sub-group of the
same name.

Decision process:
1. Generate the base slug from the entity name (e.g., `scorponok`)
2. Check if that slug exists in the **correct** slug set for this entity type
   (e.g., `existingCharacterSlugs` for characters, `existingFactionSlugs` for factions)
3. **If no collision in that set**: use the base slug as-is — even if the name appears in
   other tables or continuities, the first one to be seeded gets the base slug
4. **If collision in that set**: append the continuity abbreviation (e.g., `megatron-bw`
   because `megatron` already exists in `existingCharacterSlugs`)

Examples:
- `optimus-primal` — unique name, no suffix needed (no G1 character named "Optimus Primal")
- `predacon` (faction slug) — no suffix needed. The sub-group `predacons` exists but that's
  a different table (`existingSubGroupSlugs`), not `existingFactionSlugs`
- `megatron-bw` — suffix needed because `megatron` already exists in `existingCharacterSlugs` (G1)
- `dinobot-bw` — suffix needed because `dinobot` already exists in `existingCharacterSlugs`
- `scorponok-bw` — suffix needed because `scorponok` already exists in `existingCharacterSlugs`
- `inferno-bw` — suffix needed because `inferno` already exists in `existingCharacterSlugs`

The `existingCharacterKeys` set (name + franchise_slug + continuity_family_slug) prevents
duplicate character entries. The slug must be unique across ALL character files regardless
of franchise.

## Characters

**Target file**: `api/db/seed/characters/{continuity-slug}-characters.json`

File naming — one file per continuity family:
- G1: `g1-characters.json`
- Beast Era: `beast-era-characters.json`
- Other: `{continuity-slug}-characters.json`

Characters within a file are ordered by narrative chronology (e.g., S1 → S2 → Movie → S3 → S4
→ toy-only → JP series).

### Record format

```json
{
  "name": "Optimus Prime",
  "character_type": "Transformer",
  "alt_mode": "Freightliner FL86 semi-truck with trailer",
  "is_combined_form": false,
  "notes": "Autobot leader. Voiced by Peter Cullen. Killed in the 1986 movie, resurrected in S3",
  "slug": "optimus-prime",
  "faction_slug": "autobot",
  "sub_group_slugs": [],
  "continuity_family_slug": "g1",
  "franchise_slug": "transformers"
}
```

### Required fields

`name`, `slug`, `franchise_slug`, `continuity_family_slug`, `character_type`, `is_combined_form`

### FK resolution

- `faction_slug` → `factions.slug` (nullable)
- `franchise_slug` → `franchises.slug`
- `continuity_family_slug` → `continuity_families.slug`
- Each entry in `sub_group_slugs[]` → `sub_groups.slug`

### Combiner and relationship rules

- Combined forms keep `is_combined_form: true` as a denormalized flag for query performance
- All combiner, vehicle-crew, binary-bond, and other relationships are modeled in **relationship
  files** (`api/db/seed/relationships/`), NOT on character records. See [Character Relationships](#character-relationships).
- `is_combined_form` must be consistent with relationship data: every `is_combined_form: true`
  character must have `combiner-component` relationships targeting it, and vice versa

**Combiners are NOT sub-groups.** Combiner teams (e.g., Magnaboss, Tripredacus, Superion) are
modeled via relationship records. Sub-groups are for named teams that are NOT defined by combining
(e.g., Dinobots, Aerialbots as a team, Minibots). The existing `predacons` and `aerialbots`
sub-groups represent the team identity, not the combining relationship.

### Name uniqueness

The tuple `(name.toLowerCase(), franchise_slug, continuity_family_slug)` must be globally unique
across all character files.

---

## Character Relationships

**Target file**: `api/db/seed/relationships/{continuity-slug}-relationships.json`

File naming — one file per continuity family, matching character files:
- G1: `g1-relationships.json`
- Beast Era: `beast-era-relationships.json`
- ARAH: `arah-relationships.json`

Relationships within a file are grouped by type, then ordered by entity1.slug, then entity2.slug.

Files are **auto-discovered** by the validation test (glob `relationships/*.json`) — no manual
registration required.

### Record format

```json
{
  "type": "combiner-component",
  "subtype": null,
  "entity1": { "slug": "superion", "role": "gestalt" },
  "entity2": { "slug": "air-raid", "role": "right leg" },
  "metadata": {}
}
```

Each record represents ONE pair. A 5-member combiner team = 5 records (one per component).

### Required fields

`type`, `entity1` (with `slug` and `role`), `entity2` (with `slug` and `role`), `metadata`

`subtype` is required for some types (see type registry below), nullable for others.

### FK resolution

- `entity1.slug` → `characters.slug` (must exist in seed data)
- `entity2.slug` → `characters.slug` (must exist in seed data)

### Relationship type registry

| Type | Subtype | entity1.role | entity2.role | Cross-validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `combiner-component` | null | `gestalt` | body-part role or null | entity1 must have `is_combined_form: true`; each entity2 in at most one combiner |
| `binary-bond` | required: `headmaster`, `targetmaster`, `powermaster`, `brainmaster`, `godmaster` | `host` | `head-partner`, `weapon-partner`, `engine-partner`, `face-partner`, `transtector-partner` | both must be characters |
| `vehicle-crew` | optional: `packaged-with`, `media-assigned` | `vehicle` | `driver`, `pilot`, `gunner`, `commander`, `crew` | entity1 must have `character_type: "Vehicle"` |
| `rival` | null | `rival` | `rival` | symmetric: entity1.slug < entity2.slug alphabetically |
| `sibling` | optional: `twin`, `clone` | `sibling` or `twin` | `sibling` or `twin` | symmetric: entity1.slug < entity2.slug alphabetically |
| `mentor-student` | null | `mentor` | `student` | asymmetric |
| `evolution` | optional: `upgrade`, `reformatting`, `reconstruction` | `base-form` | `evolved-form` | asymmetric; no cycles |

### entity2.role values for combiner-component

`torso`, `right arm`, `left arm`, `right leg`, `left leg`, `upper torso`, `lower torso`,
`upper body`, `lower body`, `torso (right half)`, `torso (left half)`, `main body`,
`wings/booster`, `weapon`, `back-mounted weapon`, `back`, or `null` (for undocumented roles)

### Uniqueness

No two records may share the same `(type, entity1.slug, entity2.slug)` tuple across all files.

For symmetric types (`rival`, `sibling`): entity1.slug must be alphabetically less than
entity2.slug to prevent duplicate reversed declarations.

For `combiner-component`: each entity2.slug may appear at most once across all records of this
type (a component belongs to exactly one gestalt).

### Generating relationships alongside characters

When adding new combiner teams, binary bond pairs, or vehicle-crew assignments, you MUST create
relationship records in the corresponding relationship file. Character records no longer carry
`combined_form_slug`, `combiner_role`, or `component_slugs` — those fields have been replaced
by relationship records.

---

## Character Appearances

**Target file**: `api/db/seed/appearances/{continuity-slug}-appearances.json`

File naming — one file per continuity family (combined, not per-media-type):
- G1: `g1-appearances.json`
- Beast Era: `beast-era-appearances.json`
- Other: `{continuity-slug}-appearances.json`

Appearances within a file are ordered to match their character file's chronological order.

### Record format

```json
{
  "slug": "optimus-prime-g1-cartoon",
  "name": "Optimus Prime (G1 Cartoon)",
  "character_slug": "optimus-prime",
  "description": "Tall, broad-shouldered red and blue robot with iconic silver faceplate and blue eyes. Transforms into a red Freightliner FL86 cab-over-engine semi-truck with gray trailer",
  "source_media": "TV",
  "source_name": "The Transformers Season 1",
  "year_start": 1984,
  "year_end": 1985,
  "metadata": {}
}
```

### Required fields

`slug`, `name`, `character_slug`, `source_media`, `source_name`

### FK resolution

- `character_slug` → `characters.slug` (must already exist in seed data)

### Description writing

Descriptions should be factual visual descriptions of the character's design in that specific
media appearance. Derive from: alt_mode, faction colors, distinctive design features, and
well-established character design knowledge. These are descriptions of well-documented fictional
character designs, not fabricated data.

---

## Items

**Target file**: `api/db/seed/items/{manufacturer-slug}/{continuity-family-or-line}.json`

### Record format

```json
{
  "product_code": "05701",
  "name": "Bumblebee",
  "slug": "05701-bumblebee",
  "character_slug": "bumblebee",
  "character_appearance_slug": "bumblebee-g1-cartoon",
  "year_released": 1984,
  "is_third_party": false,
  "size_class": null,
  "manufacturer_slug": "hasbro",
  "toy_line_slug": "the-transformers-g1",
  "metadata": {
    "status": "released",
    "variant_type": null,
    "base_product_code": null,
    "sub_brand": "The Transformers",
    "notes": "Series 1 Mini Vehicle. Micro Change MC-04 Mini CAR Robo mold. Yellow Volkswagen Beetle"
  }
}
```

### Required fields

`name`, `slug`, `product_code`, `character_slug`, `manufacturer_slug`, `toy_line_slug`,
`is_third_party`, `metadata` (must be an object, even if `{}`)

### Forbidden fields

NEVER include integer ID fields: `manufacturer_id`, `toy_line_id`, `character_id`,
`character_faction_id`, `character_sub_group_id`

### FK resolution

- `character_slug` → `characters.slug` (**NOT nullable** — every item must have a character)
- `character_appearance_slug` → `character_appearances.slug` (nullable)
- `manufacturer_slug` → `manufacturers.slug`
- `toy_line_slug` → `toy_lines.slug`

### Complete chain rule

**Every item requires a complete character → appearance → item chain.** If you generate an item
for a character that doesn't exist in seed data, you MUST also generate:

1. A **character record** in the appropriate character file
2. At minimum a **`Toy-only` appearance** with `source_media: "Toy-only"` and
   `source_name: "{Toy Line Name}"` (e.g., "Beast Wars Transformers Toy Line")

The existing G1 data follows this pattern exactly: 440 characters, 508 appearances (161 are
`Toy-only`), 277 items — zero null `character_slug` values. Toy-only characters (those with
no cartoon/comic appearance) still get a character record and a `Toy-only` appearance.

Do NOT generate items with null `character_slug`. If you can't create the character record
in the same batch, move the item to `_metadata.unresolved_characters` and skip it.

### Appearance slug selection for items

| Item type | Appearance to use |
| --- | --- |
| Third-party standard (cartoon-accurate MP) | `{char}-g1-cartoon` |
| Third-party "Toy Deco" variant | `{char}-g1-toy` |
| Original Hasbro G1 toy (1984-1990) | `{char}-g1-toy` if it exists (livery divergence), else `{char}-g1-cartoon` |
| Action Masters (non-transforming) | `{char}-g1-cartoon` (always) |
| Legends / simplified reissues | `{char}-g1-cartoon` |
| JP-only characters | `{char}-jp-headmasters`, `{char}-jp-masterforce`, or `{char}-jp-victory` |

### Multi-character products

Schema requires exactly one `character_slug` per item:
- **Cassette 2-packs**: first-listed character as `character_slug`, second in `metadata.notes`
- **Combiner giftsets**: combined form's `character_slug`
- **2-pack slug**: `{code}-{char1}-and-{char2}` (e.g., `05731-ravage-and-rumble`)

### Official Hasbro G1 items (1984-1990)

- `is_third_party`: always `false`
- `size_class`: always `null` (predates modern size classes)
- `manufacturer_slug`: `"hasbro"`
- `toy_line_slug`: `"the-transformers-g1"`
- `metadata.sub_brand`: `"The Transformers"`
- Product codes: 5-digit Hasbro numbers from TFArchive. When only assortment codes available,
  note in metadata. When undocumented, use `"UNKNOWN"` with `hasbro-{name}-g1` slug format.
